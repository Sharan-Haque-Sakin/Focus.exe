      <h1>Train your brain to do the hard things! </h1>
      <h2>The Problem </h2>
      <p>
        This is maybe one of the greatest problem of this generation.We can't
        focus on a specific task at a time.Genuinely where we trouble to focus
        are the most important works!That could be our study , that could be our
        office work or maybe learning or reading a book. We procastinate.
        <br />
        <u>
          <b>What I meant by focus is:</b>
        </u>
        to do work without any interruption anything..Mainly doing any working
        with full of your concentration.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Why we can't focus? ü§î </h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        The actual reason which plays the most significant role of for our lack
        of concentration is a neurotransmitter of our brain called{" "}
        <u>
          {" "}
          <b>Dopamine</b>
        </u>
        .It is the chemical of our brain which is responsible to give us
        pleasure , motivation , inspiration and some other important things
        which are the most important thing which are playing significant role to
        keep us stay alive (indirectly).When it is released,we feel pleasure.To
        give you a clear understanding that how much this is important for us ,I
        will like to give you a example:-{" "}
        <i>
          The motivations for eating food and water are also driven by this
          damn!At the same time this is also the chemical which release in our
          brain when someone drinks alcohol,drugs etc!
        </i>
        Now I think,now you have a clearified view about the importancy of
        DOPAMINE.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>How it works in the overworld:</b>
        </u>
        Now you might think,"Dude what's the problem?It gives us pleasure even
        motivation.How it could be the reason for our lack of Focus?! Screw You!
        ".Here'your answer-We all use social media..Or at least youtube or
        tiktok..Where we do nothing but scrolling..And belive me escaping from
        scrolling(End of scrolling) while using social media is Complicated than
        sending a rocket by defeating the graviational pull of earth (where it
        needs 11km/s of speed!)..In a simple word impossible!When you scroll,
        your brain releases Dopamine and You start getting stimulated... And
        this feeling is not even happiness.This is stimulation...Kinda like your
        brain is Manupulating you!The more you scroll the more you get
        manupulated.And the Law comes here (like Newton's Law of Gravitation)-
        <i>When you are stimulated,you loose you ability to focus.</i>You start
        looking for the next release of Dopamine and so on..
        <b>
          <i>Man you are getting in a never ending loop!</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <h2>How to esacape this never ending loop-</h2>
      <p>
        When you are engaging in high stimulating activity,yourbrain will keep
        demanding more and more stimulation. As your level of stimulation rises,
        regular and important work start appealing dull. You start asking your
        self(Consiously or unconsiously) why doing this boring stuffs,when I
        could be doing something far more exciting??
        <br />
        And you have to escape this.Remember you can't swim with peace and
        perfection in wavey water.But you can do it in calm water.
        <br />
        So simple the Formula is to{" "}
        <b>
          <i>Be Bore</i>
        </b>
        . Practise Boredom..Now I know this is a very difficult task to
        accomplish because who wants to be bore?Specially when the norm of your
        brain is stimulation.
        <br />
        <b>But I have got you some tricks</b> üòÅ!
      </p>
      <h2>1.Increase friction with your phone:</h2>
      <p>
        Keep your phone in a place where it is difficult for you to access
        it.Where many tasks are required in order to get yourself to phone.The
        most easy way is turn off your phone ,keep it in drawer where you can
        lock it and keep the key somewhere far from you..But the fact is what if
        someone call you in your phone. What if it is a very important call? So
        here is the second approach-
      </p>
      <br />
      <i>
        Btw,you can keep your phone in this condition for 1 day only..Be bore
        the whole day and from the next day Insha Allah you will be able to
        focus.But be care full don't get involve again in those things..
      </i>
      <h2>2.Delete the materials:)</h2>
      <p>
        Don't yell at me please.Because it is the only way for you to get ride
        of this.There are various and many videos in youtube regarding the bad
        effects of social media. Seldom you find will any benifite(Only from
        Mark Zuckerberg,perhaps ü§ì )
      </p>

      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        This were the 2 ways known to me which basically helped me getting my
        focus back.
        <br />
        Always remember{" "}
        <i>
          <b>Your attention is the new currency.</b>
        </i>
        Don't let them(industries) steel it.There is no problem if you miss any
        latest news.Because there is always latest news that will want to grab
        your attention..Don't let it be done.When something is improtant, it
        will come to you automatic.You don't have to find them.Just do your work
        and focus on your life.
